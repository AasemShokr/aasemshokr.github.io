                            <h1>Hi Developers,</h1>

<p>in this article I'll be talking about several ways you can monetize your game <strong>(mobile game specifically)</strong>  </p>

<p>I'll assume you are using Unity engine, let's be honest guys, it is so popular and offers a lot of tools when it comes to monetization leaving the easy part for you <strong>(place ads and earn money!)</strong>  </p>

<p>of course this isn't limited just to unity, these ad networks that we will discuss I believe they also have SDKs for other engines and maybe for Native game development if required!  </p>

<p>when it comes to monetization in games, I believe that it is very crucial to place your ads in a way without making players instantly close your game and leave a bad review for the game saying '<strong>Too many ads!</strong>'  </p>

<p>trust me that will prevent your game from organically growing in the store, you dont want that i guess.  </p>

<h2>Why do we need this in video games?</h2>

<p><strong><em>Obvoisly we make games for two reasons.</em></strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>We Love Making Games!</li>
<li>We Make Games to make money!  </li>
</ul>

<p>let's stick with the second reason for now.<br />
we make game to make money, so I think you didn't spend about 4-5 months making a game that will not make you money!  </p>

<p>I think getting this part done effectively is totally worth it in terms of the revenue it generates when done well.  </p>

<h2>Guaranteed profit</h2>

<hr />

<p>if you ave made a title and don't want to make it free to play, consider forgetting putting ads in your game at all!<br />
maybe in some rare cases you can, but that's not the point of this article, maybe I'll talk about it in another article. Just to give myself some space. Anyway,<br />
Making your game paid guarantees you the full profit of your game depending on your downloads, I mean for example if you make your game for 0.99$ (one dollar - that cent is subtracted for tax purposes).<br />
if you sell million copies then your estimated revenue is 'basically' Million dollars. but I'll be honest with you, that's is a kind of hard and tricky in the same time to achive. Aart from that, users must understand the value of your game before they buy and so on.<br />
if you are have a Google Play developer console account you can check <a href="https://playacademy.exceedlms.com/uploads/resource_courses/targets/78352/original/index.html?_courseId=10793#/page/5dbb7b2571ede84d1a31d5e5">This Guide from Google</a><br />
If your app is largely designed for casual use, advertising and in-app products are likely going to be effective forms of monetization.  </p>

<p><strong>In general, parents are more likely to pay for an ad-free, child-friendly app than a<br />
casual use app. Also, business users often want an ad-free, high quality app to use at<br />
work. For cases like these, consider making your app a paid app.</strong>  </p>

<h3><strong>Google</strong></h3>

<p>I don't think you are here to read this, so I'll get straight into the point.  </p>

<h2>Revenue Generation ( Monetization in free apps )</h2>

<hr />

<p>Generating Revenue from displaying ads inside some placements in your game is a way of generatig revenue, as advertisers work with ad networks (Ad providers for your game).<br />
basically the way this works is that they pay the network for displaying ads in your game and the network shares that with you depending on the number of ad impressions your game requests wich depends on your DAU (Daily active users).<br />
but all of that can Make you a millionaire or just destroy your game (if not done well).<br />
today I'll discuss with you some of the ad networks out there and the pros and cons from my point of view and my experience with them.  </p>

<h2><strong>1. Unity Ads</strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><img src="https://appmediation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Unity-ads-1.png" alt="unity_ads" />
first of all, if you are a unity developer consider talking a look at <a href="https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/monetization/getting-started">Getting Started Guide From Unity</a>  </p>

<p>Unity ads help publishers integrate video ads into their games that maximize revenue and improves the user experience. They offer the highest revenue per user of any rewarded video ad network.  </p>

<p>They work with publishers such as SEGA, Halfbrick, and Next Games to monetize their user base with video ads. Developers can offer gamers a variety of options such as additional life, currency, score increases and more in exchange for watching a video.  </p>

<p>This ad network focuses on increasing the lifetime value of a user instead of mere fill rates and eCPM values. The setup is simple, especially for those using the Unity engine. If not, you’ll only need to implement their universal SDK.  </p>

<h2><strong>2. Google Admob</strong></h2>
